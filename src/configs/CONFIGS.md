# CONFIGS

> _Configs will be implemented officially in the nearest future_

Lentil supports intergration with third party services for things such
as logging, database management, authentication, and caching. Support for 
more kinds of services will come later.

## How do I configure my server instance?

Lentil ships with gui interface for setting up these configurations. Upon the 
first boot of your server instance, Lentil will prompt you to provide your 
optional configurations, and will use these server configurations on restarts, 
and on boot-ups unless disabled.

Configurations can always be readily enabled or disabled at the start of the 
boot-up.

## current suppported configurations
