First off, thanks for your interest in contributing to Lentil! These guidelines are meant to keep things simple and straightforward.

## 1. Getting Started

- **Fork** the repository and **clone** your fork locally.
- Install any prerequisites (e.g. language runtime, package manager).
- Create a **feature branch**:
- git checkout -b my-feature-branch

## 2. Filing Issues

- Search the existing issues to see if your bug/feature request already exists.
- If not, open a new issue with:
- A clear, descriptive title.
- A concise description of the problem or enhancement.

## 3. Submitting Pull Requests

- Make your changes on a topic branch.
